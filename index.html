        <h1>Some things to share:</h1>   
        <p>My name is<em> <strong> Claire.</strong></em> <br> <br> I have <strong> long</strong> hair. My favorite animal is a bear. <br> <br>I'm <big> 5'10"</big> if you care.<br> <br> At art, I like to stare. I <b> despise</b> cold air. <br><br>I have three younger brothers that I cannot bare. <br><br>Too many times, I curse and swear. I prefer the ground, not a chair. All kinds of music, I like to blare. </p>
